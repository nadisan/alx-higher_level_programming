How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
=============================

This modules defines a base geometry class BaseGeometry.

Instantiation
=============

``BaseGeometry`` includes no attributes, and accordingly is initialized 
with no arguments.

::
	>>>BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
	>>>bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>>type(bg)
	<class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>
::
	>>> print(bg) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
	<7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry object at ...>

	In fact, any arguments supplied to an instantiation of "BaseGeomtry" results in a TypeError.

::
	>>>bg = BaseGeometry(None)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
   	TypeError: object() takes no parameters

Methods
=======
"BaseGeomety features two methods - "area(self)" and
"integer_validator(self, name, value)". "area(...)" is not yet implemented

::
	>>>bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>>print(bg.area) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
	<bound method BaseGeometry.area of <7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry 
     object at...>>
